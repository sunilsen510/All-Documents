🧩 1. Basics of Redux

Goal: Understand what Redux is and why it’s used.

What is Redux?

Why use Redux (problems it solves)?

Core principles of Redux (Single Source of Truth, State is Read-Only, Changes via Pure Functions)

Redux architecture overview

Difference between Redux and Context API

Redux vs useState/useReducer (in React)

⚙️ 2. Redux Core Concepts

Goal: Learn the fundamental building blocks.

Store

State

Actions

Reducers

Dispatch

Subscribe method

Combine Reducers (combineReducers)

Middleware (concept overview)

Example:
A simple counter app using Redux (no React yet).

⚛️ 3. Integrating Redux with React

Goal: Use Redux in React applications.

Installing Redux and React-Redux

Provider Component (<Provider>)

useSelector() Hook

useDispatch() Hook

MapStateToProps and MapDispatchToProps (Class Components)

Connecting components using connect()

Updating and reading state in React components

Example:
React Counter App with Redux.

🧠 4. Redux Toolkit (RTK)

Goal: Modern, simplified Redux workflow.

What is Redux Toolkit and why use it?

Installing @reduxjs/toolkit

configureStore()

createSlice()

createAction()

createReducer()

Using Immer in RTK (mutating state safely)

Accessing actions and reducers from a slice

Using multiple slices in a store

Example:
Todo App using Redux Toolkit.

🔄 5. Asynchronous Logic (Async Redux)

Goal: Handle API calls and async actions.

Redux Thunk (Concept & Setup)

Using createAsyncThunk() (Redux Toolkit)

Handling Loading, Success, and Error states

Using Redux DevTools for debugging async flows

Introduction to Redux Saga (optional advanced middleware)

Comparing Thunk vs Saga

Example:
Fetch users/posts from an API using Redux Toolkit & createAsyncThunk().

🧰 6. Middleware and DevTools

Goal: Enhance Redux functionality.

What is Middleware?

Built-in Middleware examples (Thunk, Logger)

Custom Middleware example

Integrating Redux DevTools

Debugging state and actions

🧱 7. Redux Store Structure & Best Practices

Goal: Organize scalable Redux apps.

Normalizing state shape

Splitting reducers and slices

Using selectors for derived data

Avoiding deeply nested state

Folder structure for large Redux apps

Immutable updates (why and how)

🔐 8. Advanced Redux Patterns

Goal: Master real-world scenarios.

Reusable slices

Lazy loading reducers (code splitting)

Persisting state (redux-persist)

Memoization with Reselect

TypeScript with Redux Toolkit

Handling forms in Redux

Authentication flow using Redux

🧩 9. Redux Middleware Alternatives

Goal: Compare different async/middleware solutions.

Redux Saga (Effects, Generators, Watchers, Workers)

Redux Observable (RxJS-based)

MobX vs Redux

🧪 10. Testing Redux

Goal: Ensure reliability of your Redux code.

Testing reducers (pure functions)

Testing actions and action creators

Testing components using mocked Redux store

Integration testing with Redux Toolkit

🚀 11. Real-World Projects (Practice Ideas)

Goal: Apply Redux in production-style apps.

Todo App with RTK

Blog App with CRUD operations

E-commerce cart management

Authentication system (Login/Logout, Token store)

Dashboard with API data management
