ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! Since you want layout-based interview questions for a web designer, I‚Äôll focus on questions that assess understanding of HTML/CSS structure, responsive design, positioning, flex/grid, alignment, and real-world layout problem solving. I‚Äôll categorize them for clarity:

üí° Tip for preparation:
A lot of interview questions are practical: they may give you a Figma/Sketch design and ask you to replicate it with responsive HTML/CSS. So, practice common layouts: header, footer, 2-3 column grids, cards, forms, and modals.

If you want, I can make a ready-to-use ‚ÄúWeb Designer Layout Interview Cheat Sheet‚Äù with 50+ real interview questions and sample answers specifically for layout and responsive design.

Perfect! I‚Äôll create a comprehensive ‚ÄúWeb Designer Layout Interview Cheat Sheet‚Äù for you. It will include 50+ questions divided into categories, with concise answers/examples so you can quickly revise before interviews.

Here‚Äôs the full cheat sheet:

Web Designer Layout Interview Cheat Sheet (Layout & Responsive Design)
1. Basic Layout Questions

What is the difference between inline, block, and inline-block?

Inline: takes width of content, cannot set width/height.

Block: takes full width, can set width/height.

Inline-block: behaves like inline but allows width/height.

Explain the CSS box model.

Content ‚Üí Padding ‚Üí Border ‚Üí Margin.

Example: div { padding: 10px; border: 2px solid; margin: 5px; }

Difference between relative, absolute, fixed, sticky positioning.

Position	Effect
relative	Positioned relative to itself
absolute	Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor
fixed	        Stays relative to viewport
sticky	        Acts like relative until scroll reaches a threshold

How to center a div vertically and horizontally?

Using Flexbox:

parent { display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; }


Difference: absolute inside relative parent vs body.

Inside relative parent ‚Üí positioned relative to parent.

Inside body ‚Üí positioned relative to viewport.

2. Flexbox Questions

What is Flexbox and why use it?

One-dimensional layout model for distributing space in a container.

Explain justify-content, align-items, align-self.

justify-content: main axis alignment (row ‚Üí horizontal).

align-items: cross axis alignment (row ‚Üí vertical).

align-self: overrides align-items for individual item.

Responsive navigation bar using Flexbox:

nav { display: flex; justify-content: space-between; align-items: center; }


Make one flex item take remaining space:

.item { flex: 1; }


Difference: flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis.

flex-grow: how item grows.

flex-shrink: how item shrinks.

flex-basis: initial size before grow/shrink.

3. CSS Grid Questions

CSS Grid vs Flexbox:

Grid: 2D layout (row + column).

Flexbox: 1D layout (row OR column).

3-column layout using Grid:

container { display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 10px; }


grid-template-rows & grid-template-columns: defines row & column sizes.

Responsive Grid layout:

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  container { grid-template-columns: 1fr; }
}


grid-area & grid-template-areas:

Assign names to sections for easy layout.

grid-template-areas: "header header" "sidebar main";

4. Responsive Design Questions

What are media queries?

CSS rules applied based on screen size or device.

@media (max-width: 768px) { ... }


3-column ‚Üí 1-column on mobile:

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .column { width: 100%; }
}


em vs rem vs % vs vw/vh:

em: relative to parent font-size

rem: relative to root font-size

%: relative to parent container

vw/vh: viewport width/height

min-width, max-width, clamp() usage:

font-size: clamp(14px, 2vw, 20px);


Mobile-first approach: start styling for mobile first, then add media queries for larger screens.

5. Practical Layout Problems

Fixed sidebar + scrollable content:

sidebar { position: fixed; height: 100vh; }
main { margin-left: 250px; overflow-y: auto; }


Sticky footer:

body { display: flex; flex-direction: column; min-height: 100vh; }
footer { margin-top: auto; }


Card layout that wraps:

.container { display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; gap: 10px; }
.card { flex: 1 1 200px; }


Overlapping elements with z-index:

Higher z-index ‚Üí appears on top.

position must be relative/absolute/fixed/sticky.

Convert Figma design to HTML/CSS:

Analyze structure ‚Üí header, main, sections, footer ‚Üí create HTML ‚Üí style with CSS (Flex/Grid/Media Queries).

6. Advanced Layout Questions

inline-flex vs inline-grid vs inline-block:

inline-flex/grid: behaves like inline but supports flex/grid layout.

Mixed Flex/Grid layout example:

Header ‚Üí Flex, Main content ‚Üí Grid, Sidebar ‚Üí Flex.

Vertically center text inside dynamic height div:

parent { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; }


Equal-height columns without JS:

Flexbox or CSS Grid automatically ensures equal height.

Modern layout with clamp() & minmax():

grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));

7. Real-World Scenario Questions

How would you design a responsive login form?

How to handle multiple images/cards on different screen sizes?

Difference between absolute and fixed header.

How to make a modal perfectly centered on screen?

Techniques to optimize layout for mobile-first experience.

How to align last child differently in a flex container.

Use of order property in Flexbox.

Using gap in Flex vs Grid.

Difference between vh and % in height.

Using object-fit for responsive images.

Difference between fixed, relative, percentage-based widths.

Handling text overflow: overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis;.

Difference between inline-style, internal-style, external-style.
