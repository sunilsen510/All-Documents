üí° Tips for Learning:

Complete tasks sequentially; practice is more important than theory.

Build mini-projects after every phase to solidify knowledge.

Use GitHub to store and track your projects.

Experiment and break things ‚Äî Node.js is very forgiving but hands-on learning sticks best.

If you want, I can also create a visual roadmap diagram showing Beginner ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Projects so you can see the entire Node.js learning path at a glance.

Do you want me to make that diagram?
